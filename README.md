# HTML5videoSpeedController
I made this because all similar extensions in the Chrome web store have too much unnecessary bloat.
This extension sets all videos to a given default speed and allows the user to change the video speed per tab using a slider when the extension is clicked.

In the settings you can set the following variables:
- Default speed: The speed all HTML5 videos play at if no tab specific speed is set.
- Min speed: The lower boundary for the tab speed slider.
- Max speed: The upper boundary for the tab speed slider.
- Slider interval: The step size of the tab speed slider.
